MindFlow: The Sovereign Constitution
====================================

1\. Preamble
------------

MindFlow is an engineered ecosystem designed to facilitate the transition from cognitive fragmentation to optimal "Flow" states. This document serves as the immutable ethical and legal foundation for all development, data handling, and user interaction.

2\. The Privacy & Cybersecurity Mandate
---------------------------------------

- **Data Sovereignty:** Users retain absolute ownership of their cognitive data.

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture:** Sensitive psychological profiles must be encrypted client-side using AES-256. The server never sees raw psychological assessments.

- **Privacy-by-Design:** Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA (where biometric data is involved).

- **Audit Trails:** Every data access request is logged via a non-repudiable telemetry system.

3\. Ethical Behavioral Engineering
----------------------------------

- **Anti-Addiction Protocol:** MindFlow shall not use "dark patterns" or variable reward schedules to increase "time-on-app." Success is measured by the user's *offline* productivity and well-being.

- **Informed Consent:** Hypnotic and NLP linguistic patterns must be disclosed in the onboarding phase as "Cognitive Reframing Tools."

- **Algorithmic Neutrality:** Logic must be audited quarterly for bias in socioeconomic or cultural psychological profiling.

4\. Payment & Financial Integrity
---------------------------------

- **PCI-DSS Compliance:** All financial transactions must bypass local storage, utilizing tokenized gateways (Stripe/Adyen).

- **Transparency:** No hidden "renewal traps." One-click cancellation is a constitutional right within the app.

5\. Amendments
--------------

Any changes to this constitution require a "Logic Audit" to ensure the core mission---user empowerment---is not compromised for profit. And you're bound to explain the whole codebasis with comments---like storytelling.
