# **MindFlow V5: Product Requirements Document (PRD)**


## **1. Executive Summary**

**Vision:** What if Steve Jobs designed a "Cognitive Operating System"? **Audience:** Simon @BetterCreating (Systems-thinkers, high-performance creators, minimalist productivity enthusiasts). **Value Prop:** Moving beyond "ToDo lists" into "Cognitive Engineering." MindFlow uses NLP and ML to identify and remove psychological friction in real-time.


## **2. Problem Statement**

Simon's audience suffers from "The Friction Gap"—knowing *what* to do but being stopped by invisible cognitive loops (procrastination, anxiety, perfectionism). Standard apps track tasks; MindFlow tracks and transforms the *state* of the person doing the tasks.
