Brainwave Frequency Listing
===========================\
This is a listing of frequencies that various parties have claimed can affect the human mind or body in some way. The following sorts of frequencies are included :\
Brainwave Frequencies - These are frequencies associated with various mental states. You can coax your brainwaves to a certain frequency, and in doing so, achieve the mental state associated with that frequency.\
"Healing" Frequencies - These are frequencies that various parties claim could be used to heal illnesses of different kinds, or stimulate some region of the body (chakras). The medium used to do this varies - some of these parties used devices that generated EM fields which were applied to a precise part of the body, while others used vibration and sound.\
Natural Phenomena Frequencies - This includes natural frequencies that occur in nature [Schumann's Resonance, for instance], as well as sound tones calculated from the revolution/orbit of the various planets. The sources of these frequencies claimed that they could affect humans in a variety of ways.

These frequencies are of all types; light, sound, electrical, etc. The two- or three-character source codes after each frequency are defined at the bottom.\

Is induced in some people by the performance of a mental task such as mental arithmetic, tracing a maze, counting the number of cubes piled in a three-dimensional representation, & imaging a scene. .. More common in extroverts with low traits of neurosis & anxiety. Because Theta2 is associated with mental tasks & its influence is seen in evoked potential latencies, Mizuki (1987) believes that the appearance of Theta2 closely relates to mechanisms of attention or arousal.

9.0 - 13.0 - Alpha Range (according to [VUG]) - relaxed, not thinking about anything in particular, sometimes a pleasurable feeling of "floating". Often dominant in certain kinds of meditation, alpha waves have for the past twenty years been associated with calm, lucid mental states (the "alpha state"). They're also often detected during dream sleep. This pattern typically occurs in daydreaming, relaxed awareness, guided or focused imagery & smoothly rhythmic athletic activity. There's often a euphoric, effortless feeling of "flow" as the doer is absorbed in activity and subject + object are felt to be united. [VUG via DW]\

15.0-18.0 Beta (mid) - increased mental ability, focus, alertness, IQ [NEU]\
15-24 Euphoria [SS]\
-I will vouch for this one - I find -binaurally produced tones between 18 HZ and 21 HZ have very pleasant results, in a jogger's high sort of way. This effect seems the strongest around 20 HZ. While other sources equate this frequency range with stress, I'm thinking it might be like the roar of a car engine - in small doses, it can be quite a rush, but too much of it can lead to a headache. The -serotonin system is funny like that. [MPT]\
15 chronic pain [MB]; Sound which bypasses the ears for sublimination (auditory cortex) [RA]; Associated with Crown/Sahasrara chakra (Color=Violet/White) (Body Parts=Pineal, Upper Brain, Right Eye)(Effects=Integration of personality & spirituality.)(Note=B) [OML]\

27.5 lowest note on a piano [MP2]\
30 Meg Patterson used for marijuana. [MB3]\
30 - 60 Gamma Range - little known but includes decision making in a fear situation, muscle tension, [EH]\
-[INT] considers Gamma to start at 40 HZ.\
30 - 190 Lumbago [AT]\
30-500 High Beta: Not associated currently with any state of mind. Some effects have been observed, but currently not enough research has been done in this area, to prove, or disprove, anything.; a few people able to replicate at will (?? - not sure what that last point means)\
-Starting at 30 HZ, sources begin to seriously disagree over what the names of each range are.\
-[EH] considers 30 to be the beginning of the Gamma range, which it believes run to 60. It then considers 60 to 120 to be the Lambda range.\
-Incidentally, [INT] believes that 40 is where Beta ends & Gamma begins.\
31.32 Schumann Resonance (5th frequency of 7) - pituitary stimulation to release growth hormone (helps develop muscle, recover from injuries, rejuvenation effects) [HSW]\

40.0 - dominant when problem solving in fearful situations. [EQ] ; Gamma - associated with information-rich task processing & high-level information processing [NEU]; "'For scientists who study the human brain, even its simplest act of perception is an event of astonishing intricacy. 40 Hz brain activity may be a kind of binding mechanism', said Dr. Rodolfo Llinas a professor of neuroscience at New York University. Llinas believes that the 40-cycle-per-second wave serves to connect structures in the cortex where advanced information processing occurs, and the thalamus, a lower brain region where complex relay & integrative functions are carried out." [NME via NEU]; Used in conjunction with 22 HZ for 'out of body' travel [EWI via DW]; Also used with 22 HZ for psychic healing. [FAH via DW]; "40--Hz activity varies from 38.8 to 40.1-Hz, regardless of the electrode site. The average frequency is in the ~39.5-Hz range. In summary, when the body is profoundly relaxed & the mind is in a state of high focus and concentration, 20 & 40-Hz brain activity can be seen in the raw and quantitative EEG of some subjects. It is possible that 18 to 22-Hz Beta & possibly 40-Hz neurofeedback training may help create a "relaxed body/focused mind" state of consciousness." [DW]; Activity in the ectosylvian & lateral cortex, medial geniculate, reticular formation, center median thalamus & hippocampus [ROW via DW]; Confirming Sheer et al.'s work,compared the EEG of middle- & high-I.Q. subjects during mental multiplication activity. A 40-Hz rhythm occurred just prior to the subject's answering the question. Forty--Hz pulses are thought to lead to synchronization + coordination of neurons assigned to the processing of incoming sensory stimulation. Put in "computerese," 40-Hz may be the brain's "operating system" frequency [GIA via DW]\
-Considered the dividing point between beta waves + gamma waves, although there's some disagreement about this. [INT] -<http://brain.web-us.com/40hz/default.htm>\
45.0 Schumann Resonance [7th frequency of 7](TS)\
46.98 - Useful for "weird effects" (use with 62.64 HZ and 70.47 HZ) [TB]\
-[TB] gets the award for most ambiguous description. Although, I'm including it since it's a very specific frequency. I'll research it further and try to dig up some additional information.\
50-60 Documented negative effects too numerous to mention There is no correlation given with signal strength or modality used, i.e. audio-visual, EMF, magnetic, electrostatic, gravitic. Also, most ELF research is now Govt classified, particularly since the mid-1960's when Hamer discovered behavioral effects as the result of applied sinusoidal field gradients as low as 4 volts. [SS via DW]\
50.0 - dominant frequency of polyphasic muscle activity, mains electrical in U.K. [EQ]; Slower cerebral rhythms [??]\
55.0 - Tantric yoga; stimulates the kundalini. [×]\
60 - 120 Lambda Range - Little known but includes central nervous system activity [EH]\
60 electric power lines\
62.64 - Useful for "weird effects". (use with 46.98 HZ and 70.47 HZ) [TB]\
63 Astral projection [×]\

82.3 Associated with bladder (higher octave of 2.57 HZ) [TOS]\
83 Third eye opening for some people\
85.5 Associated with intestines (higher octave of 2.67 HZ) [TOS]\
90.0 - 111.0 Pleasure-producing beta-endorphins rise between these frequencies. [PSI]\
-In the MIDI scale, the notes that would fall in this range begin with F#3 and go up to A3. ["A3" being the fourth octave up -- since there's an A0, and A1, A2 lower than it.] Playing the F#3 and the A3 as a chord seems to function as a good painkiller. An additional undertone in the alpha range of frequencies sometimes helps too. [Try adding a tone around 12.5 HZ].\
90.0 Good feelings, security, well-being, balancing [??]\
95.0-125.0 Acoustical Resonances of Assorted Ancient Structures [ACS via DW]\
95.0 Use for pain along with 3040 HZ [ESR]\
98.4 Associated with hara (3cm or 1.5 inch below navel, balance of pelvis) (higher octave of 3.07 HZ) [TOS]\
100 Can help with pain [used with electrical stimulation] [CMP]\

125 Graham potentializer; Stimulation [MH]\
126.22 Sun, 32nd octave of Earth year [HC]; The Frequency Of The Sun (Note=C) (Color=Green) (Tempo=118.3 BPM) (Chakra=Manipura, also called Hara {associated with Navel & 3rd lumbar vertebrae}) (Effects=advances the feeling of centering of magic & of the transcendental) [HC/Planetware website]\
-There seems to be a little disagreement between [HC] & [HC/Planetware] over what exactly this is the frequency of - [HC] ties this into the period it takes the earth to revolve around the sun, while [HC/Planetware] says this is the frequency it would take an imaginary planet to orbit the outside edge of the sun. My money is on the second, since there is another frequency that is given for the Earth year. (136.1 HZ)\
-This is tricky to paraphrase, so here it is as it appeared on the Planetware website :\
"Meditation carried out to this tone will lead to state beyond good and bad, shame and guilt, beyond space and time, knowledge and wisdom, action and rest an being and not-being. It leads to a state where being has no name, to a state where the all-one and the all encompassing are no longer separate entities but are reunited at their one common origin, the origin that is also you."\
132.0 Associated with kidneys (Effects=strength) (higher octave of 4.11 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with coccyx (small triangular bone at end of the spinal column) (higher octave of 2.06 HZ) [TOS]\
136.1 Sun: light, warmth, joy, animus [RV]; Resonates with the earth year (Note=C#) (Color=Turqouise Green) (Effects=calming, meditative, relaxing, centering) [PSI]; Period it takes earth to revolve around sun (Tempo=63.8*127.6) (Chakra=Anahate/Heart chakra)(Effects=relaxing, soothing, balancing, harmony with the cosmos, associated with the soul {"frequency of the soul}) (Medicinal=Sedative) (Other=significant tone in Indian music {called it the "sadja" or "father to others" - it was a keynote} - corresponds to "OM" & the Christian "AMEN") [HC/Planetware website]\
-Note : [PSI] seems to disagree a bit with the original source on the list. [PSI] says this one calms/centers, while the original source seems to associate it with happiness. Also some disagreement between [RV] and [HC/Planetware], once associating this with the sun, and the other associating this with the frequency with the earth year. I suppose you could associate the earth year with the sun, since it's the time it takes the earth to go around the sun, but 126.22 HZ uses "frequency of the sun" in a little different context. See the comments with that frequency for more.\
140.25 Pluto: power, crisis & changes [??]; Frequency associated with the orbit of Pluto; (Note=C#) (Color=blue-green) (Tempo=65.7* 131.4 BPM) (Effects = support the magic group dynamic principle and is said to be responsible for integration into certain structures of society) [HC/Planetware website]\
-I think my first reaction to the effects listed is "huh?".\
141.27 Mercury: intellectuality, mobility [??]; Frequency associated with orbit of Mercury (Note=C# or D) (Color=blue-green or blue) (Tempo=66.2) (Chakra=Vishudda/Throat chakra) (Effects=Supports speech center and communicative-intellectual principle, associated with communication and cleverness) [HC/Planetware]\
-[HC/Planetware] says the frequencies of planets revolving around the sun are less important than those of the moon, sun, and Earth.\
-Again, I'm not sure how [HC/planetware] is associating these frequencies with these chakras. {shrugs}\
-A discrepancy in the note and color - they're both given twice - once as C# and blue-green, the second time as D and blue.\
-[HC/Planetware] and [BH] seem to associate different frequencies with the revolutions of each planet - these frequencies are determined by HC/Planetware by taking higher octaves of the actual period - octaves that are in the audible range. [BH] might use even higher octaves than [HC/Planetware] does, or some other method completely.\
144.0 (helps with) headaches [Medium=pad](JB)\
144.72 Mars: activity, energy, freedom, humor [??] ; Frequency associated with the orbit of Mars (Note=D) (Color=blue) (Tempo=67.8 *135.6 BPM) (Effect : Supports strength of will and focused energy, ability for achievement) [HC/Planetware]\
147.0 Associated with the spleen/blood (Effects=Emotional Impulse) (higher octave of 4.6 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with genitals (higher octave of 2.30 HZ) [TOS]\
147.85 Saturn: separation, sorrow, death [??]; Frequency associated with orbit of Saturn (Note=D) (Color=Blue) (Tempo=69.3* 138.6 BPM) (Effects=enhances concentration and the process of becoming conscious + shows very clearly karmic connections, brings structure and order - is considered to be a cosmic controller) [HC/Planetware]\
-I'm not completely sure what the dual tempo means. I'll have to research that further.\
160.0 Appears to be involved in stimulating 5-hydroxytryptamine production, with 80 Hz. [EQ]; Use for rapid relief from headaches [ESR]\
-That makes sense, since 160 HZ would be one octave up from 80 HZ. [like hitting C on a piano, and then the next C up - same note, higher pitch]\
164.3 Frequency associated with Gall Bladder [Note=E] [BH1][BH4]\
165.0 Associated with stomach (Effects=Emotional Acceptance) (higher octave of 5.14 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with bladder (higher octave of 2.57 HZ) [TOS]\
171.0 Associated with lungs (Effects=Oxygen, Heat) (higher octave of 5.35 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with intestines (higher octave of 2.67 HZ) [TOS]\
172.06 - Resonates with the Platonic year {about 26,000 years} (Note=F) (Color=purple-violet) (Effects=joyful, cheerful, spiritual effect) [PSI]; The Frequency Of The Platonic Year (Color=red-violet {purple}) (Tempo=80.6 BPM) (Chakra=Sahasrar/Crown chakra) (Effects=cheerfulness, clarity of spirit, cosmic unity on highest levels) (Medicinal=antidepressive) (Other=F is considered the tone of the spirit, and had a lot of significance to the Chinese)\
-Other sources [PM] disagree about the tone F being associated with the Crown chakra, which is how HC/Planetware connects this frequency to the crown chakra. [PM] considers the crown chakra to be associated with the B note, and not F.\
176.0 - Frequency associated with the colon. [Note=F or F#] [BH1][BH4]\
183.58 Jupiter: growth, success, justice, spirituality [??]  ; Frequency associated with the orbit of Jupiter (Note=F#) (Color=Red) (Tempo=86.05 * 172.1 BPM) (Effects : supports creative power and continuous construction) (Associated with Jupiter : Generosity, Continuity, Magnanimity, Joviality) [HC/planetware website]\
187.61 frequency of "moon culmination" ; [HC/planetware website]\
194.18 frequency of Synodic "Earth" Day {the "day tone"} (Note=G) (Color=Orange Red) (Tempo=91.0 BPM) (Chakra=Muladhar/Base chakra) (Effects = dynamic, vitalizing)(Medicinal="tonifies") (Other="weather determining" spheric frequency, influences proteins, brings one into harmony with nature") [HC/planetware website]\
-Note : By "weather determining", [HC/planetware] seems to imply that somebody tuned into this frequency may be able to predict the weather in the short-term future. I'm just a little, little bit skeptical of this one, but if anybody has any luck with it, let me know.\
-I'm not sure how [HC/planetware] is associating these chakras to these frequencies. It doesn't seem to be based on the note, since G isn't the note typically associated with the base chakra [per PM]. The associations might tie in with something astrological instead. {shrugs}.\
194.71 Earth: stability, grounding [??]; Key Of G resonates with frequency of earth day, the color orange-red, & has a dynamic, stimulating, and energizing effect on the body-mind. [PSI]\
-There seems to be some disagreement between [PSI] and the original source for this list. [PSI] associates this frequency with energizing, while the original source associates it with stability/grounding.\
-I think this one, and the one right below it [197.71 HZ] might be based on the same thing. One source might have done a typo, and then other sources based their information from that.\
197.0 Associated with heart (Effects=love,warmth) (higher octave of 6.15) [TOS]; Associated with hara (3cm or 1.5 inch below navel, balance of pelvis) (higher octave of 3.07 HZ) [TOS]\
197.71 frequency of Sideric Day ; [HC/planetware website]\
207.36 Uranus: spontaneity, independence, originality [??]; Frequency associated with orbit of Uranus {insert one of dozens of bad jokes here} (Note=G#) (Color=Orange) (Tempo = 97.2 BMP) (Effects = supports the power of surprise and renewal, has primeval and erotic power) [HC/planetware website]\
210.42 frequency of Synodic Moon (Note=G#) (Color=orange) (Tempo=98.6 BPM) (Chakra=Svadisthan {2nd Chakra}) (Effects=stimulates sexual energy, supports erotic communication) (Medicinal=regulation of menstruation, disturbances in the gland and lymph system) [HC/planetware website]\
211.44 Neptune: the unconscious, secrets, imagination, spiritual love [??]; frequency associated with orbit of Neptune (Note=G#) (Color=orange) (Tempo=99.1 BPM) (Effects = supports intuition, the unconsciousness, and enhances the dream experience) [HC/planetware website]\
220.0 Frequency associated with lungs. [Note = A] [BH1][BH4] Associated with collarbones (Effects=vitality, overall balance, stability) (higher octave of 6.88 HZ) [TOS]; Associated with ovaries (Effects=vitality, life at very level) (higher octave of 3.84 HZ) [TOS]\
221.23 Venus: beauty, love, sexuality, sensuality, harmony [??]; Frequency associated with the orbit of Venus (Note=A) (Color=yellow-orange) (Tempo=103.7 BPM) (Chakra=Ajna/Third Eye) (Effects=supports higher love energy and aspiration for harmony) [HC/planetware website]\
-One of the few instances where the note HC/Planetware gives matches up with what the other source I have for chakras says. Both say the note for the Third Eye chakra is A.\

330.0 Used to treat allergies in conjunction with 3 HZ [RS]\
332.8 - Frequency associated with orbit of Sun (Note=E) [BH2]\
-When [BH2] says the "orbit of the sun", I believe she means how long it would take an imaginary planet to orbit around the sun's outer boundary [circumfrence]. This is how [HC/planetware] made this calculation - the period is then lowered a few octaves to get it into the audible sound range. That's how [HC/planetware] does most of its calculations, and probably how [BH] does it as well. [HC/planetware], when lowering [or in the case of planets raising] the octave, seems to gun for lower tones than [BH] does. The [HC/planetware] tones would be a little "bassier". Which is probably why the frequencies of all these astronomical phenomena that [HC/planetware] gives doesn't line up with the frequencies that [BH] gives.\
336.0 - Frequency associated with Molybdenum (mineral nutrient) [BH]\
341.0 - Heart Chakra (1:12) (Note=F) [BH3]\

352.0 - Frequency associated with bladder. (Note=F) [BH1][BH4]; Thymus Chakra (11:1) (Note=F#) [BH3]\

1.1-1.3 MHZ - Magic Window [EX via MM+TB]\
388 MHZ - Alleged to cause damage/disruption to humans [TB]\
------- Note - down from this point are GHZ [gigahertz?] values, not HZ values\
1.057 GHZ - Magic Window [EX via MM+TB]\
------- Note - down from this point are PHZ [Petahertz] values, not HZ values\
10 PHZ - Magic Window in the near ultra-violet range [EX via MM+TB]; "life energy" frequency [EX via MM]\
-[MM] describes 10 PHZ as being 10**15 HZ - does that mean 10 to the fifteenth power?
