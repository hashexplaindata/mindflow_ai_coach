MindFlow: Behavioral Science & NLP Stack
========================================

1\. Hardcore NLP Scripting (Focus Induction)
--------------------------------------------

The following script utilizes the **Milton Model** for rapid cognitive alignment:

> "As you sit there, focusing on the interface, you may find that your breathing begins to slow naturally. And as you notice that slowing, your mind can begin to filter out the unnecessary, leaving only the clarity of the task at hand. You don't even need to realize how deeply you are focusing until you find the work is already done."

**Linguistic Patterns Used:**

- **Presuppositions:** "As you notice that slowing..." (Presupposes the user is slowing down).

- **Embedded Commands:** "...begin to filter out the unnecessary."

- **Double Binds:** "You can start now or in a moment, as your mind prepares."

2\. Assessment Logic (Weighted Score)
-------------------------------------

The "Cognitive Readiness Score" ($CRS$) is calculated via:

$$CRS = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i \cdot x_i)$$

Where:

- $x_1$: Sleep quality (0-1).

- $x_2$: Self-reported stress (inverse 1-0).

- $x_3$: Success of previous 3 focus sessions.

- $w_i$: Dynamically adjusted weights based on user history.

3\. Habit Building & Relationship
---------------------------------

We implement the **Hook Model** (Nir Eyal) but with an ethical twist:

- **Trigger:** Internal (feeling of overwhelm) -> App Notification (Breathwork).

- **Action:** 60-second micro-task.

- **Variable Reward:** Cognitive "Unlock" or visual dopamine splash (non-monetary).

- **Investment:** User logs a "Win," increasing the cost of switching to a competitor.

4\. Training Criteria for Agents
--------------------------------

AI agents (LLMs) serving as coaches must be trained on:

- **Socratic Questioning:** Never give the answer; lead the user to it.

- **Validation:** Use Carl Rogers' Unconditional Positive Regard.

- **Crisis Detection:** Immediate hand-off to human resources if "self-harm" or "clinical depression" keywords are detected (Hard-coded safety layer).
