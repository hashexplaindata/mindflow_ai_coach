MindFlow: Operations & Knowledge Base
=====================================

1\. Agent Roles (The Jobs Theme)
--------------------------------

- **The Architect (Agent-A):** Responsible for the structural integrity of the SDLC and math models.

- **The Neuro-Guide (Agent-N):** Administers NLP scripts and manages the behavioral loops.

- **The Privacy Sentinel (Agent-S):** Continuously monitors the telemetry pipeline for data leaks.

- **The Concierge (Agent-C):** Handles payment modules and user support using Socratic methods.

2\. Training Criteria
---------------------

All system components must undergo:

- **Adversarial Training:** Testing the NLP scripts against "stubborn" or "rebellious" user personas to ensure resilience.

- **Bias Training:** Ensuring the "Focus Logic" doesn't penalize neurodivergent patterns (e.g., ADHD focus bursts).

4\. Rigorous Testing Protocols
------------------------------

- **Load Testing:** Simulate 100k concurrent focus sessions using JMeter.

- **A/B Testing:** Compare "Indigo" vs "Deep Slate" backgrounds for 15% increase in session length.

- **Neuro-Validation:** Correlation study between "Self-Reported Flow" and "Telemetry-Measured Focus."
